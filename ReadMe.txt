==========

Aim: To create a Noughts And Crosses game in the form of a simple console application

Notes:
- Looking to give good testing coverage so will write unit tests after a TDD fashion


Features
- Added some startup code
- the game is a high-level abstaction which manages the fundamental aspects of a game,
i.e., starting stopping, setting up etc.
- the game runner manages the progress of the game
